# MAST-680-Assignment1
Given the Monte Carlo and the Ski Drop video, the aim of this assignment is to use Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique on two video clips and separate them into foreground and background videos. We also use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the frames of the videos to perform dimensionality reduction without losing much information.

- The file "ski_video" contains the code that applies the SVD and the DMD technique on the Ski Drop video to separate the individual that's skiing from the static background. 

- The file "Monte_Carlo" contains the code that applies the same process, but on the Monte Carlo video.
